});

// Create a new source to retrieve the track that is currently playing
const spotifySource = new GitHubNowPlaying.Sources.Spotify({

 updateFrequency: 1000,
});

// Make sure a source is set before calling listen()
nowPlaying.setSource(spotifySource);

nowPlaying.on(GitHubNowPlaying.Events.Error, error => {
  console.log('something went wrong');
});

// Listen to any track changes and update the profile status accordingly.
nowPlaying.listen();

// Don't forget to stop reporting any track changes when the process exists.
process.on('SIGINT', () => {
  // Calling the stop() method will clear the profile status.
